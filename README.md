If you're a fan of video games you're familiar with "Hey listen!" &  "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this"...application as your trusty travel companion to keep you organized and out of danger. 

Start by signing up for NAVIgator (with a name nodding to the blue fairy Navi who guides characters through their adventures in the Legend of Zelda series). 

Once logged in, begin by clicking on 'Add a trip' from the top menu. View all your 'Trips' from the menu as well. Edit details and delete trips as necessary. 

From there, add more information to your trip, like 'Add Transpotation' or 'Add an Attraction'. Full edit & delete functions for these additions are coming soon.
